description: The Albany movement sought to fight the system of racial segregation. It was composed of multiple civil rights movement organisations in Albany such as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to name a few. 
songdesc: Members sung freedom songs during the meetings which became a frequent part of the marches. We Shall Overcome was labelled as the 'anthem' of the civil rights movement which is seen to have taken lyrics from a hymn by Charles Albert called 'I'll Overcome Someday'
