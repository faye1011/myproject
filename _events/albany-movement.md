description: Formed by the SNCC (Student Nonviolent Coordination Committee). SNCC members traveled to Albany in October 1961 to encourage the black community into protesting against institutionalised segregation. Prior to this, Albany experienced little protest activity and throughout the campaign they used forms of nonviolent protests such as sit-ins and mass demonstrations.
