She was one of 73 people rounded up by deputies that day after a grand jury charged 113 African Americans for organizing the boycott. This was a few months after her arrest on December 1, 1955, for refusing to give up her seat to a white passenger on a segregated municipal bus in Montgomery, Alabama.

This happened the Monday after Rosa Parks was arrested for her refusal to surrender her seat to a white person on a bus. The protest ended by the U.S Supreme Court ruling that segregation on public buses is unconstitutional.
