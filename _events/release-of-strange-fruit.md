description: Strange Fruit was originally a poem written by Abel Meeropol which was later recorded by Billie Holiday in 1939. The song has been labeled as the ‘beginning of the civil rights movement’. The song was the first time a black artist sung a song with what was deemed as such  controversial lyrics. The lyrics protest the lynching, brutiality and racism of Black Americans which  were happening in South America.
