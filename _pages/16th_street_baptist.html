          The name of this tune is Mississippi Goddam <br>
          And I mean every word of it<br>
          Alabama's gotten me so upset<br>
          Tennessee made me lose my rest<br>
          And everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam<br>
          Alabama's gotten me so upset<br>
          Tennessee made me lose my rest<br>
          And everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam<br>
          Can't you see it<br>
          Can't you feel it<br>
          It's all in the air<br>
          I can't stand the pressure much longer<br>
          Somebody say a prayer<br>
          Alabama's gotten me so upset<br>
          Tennessee made me lose my rest<br>
          And everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam<br>
          This is a show tune<br>
          But the show hasn't been written for it, yet<br>
          Hound dogs on my trail<br>
          School children sitting in jail<br>
          Black cat cross my path<br>

          I think every day's gonna be my last<br>
          Lord have mercy on this land of mine<br>
          We all gonna get it in due time<br>
          I don't belong here<br>
          I don't belong there<br>
          I've even stopped believing in prayer<br>
          Don't tell me<br>
          I tell you<br>
          Me and my people just about due<br>
          I've been there so I know<br>
          They keep on saying "Go slow!"<br>
          But that's just the trouble<br>
          "Do it slow"<br>
          Washing the windows<br>
          "Do it slow"<br>
          Picking the cotton<br>
          "Do it slow"<br>
          You're just plain rotten<br>
          "Do it slow"<br>
          You're too damn lazy<br>
          "Do it slow"<br>
          The thinking's crazy<br>
          "Do it slow"<br>

          I made you thought I was kiddin'<br>
          Picket lines<br>
          School boy cots<br>
          They try to say it's a communist plot<br>
          All I want is equality<br>
          For my sister my brother my people and me<br>
          Yes you lied to me all these years<br>
          You told me to wash and clean my ears<br>
          And talk real fine just like a lady<br>
          And you'd stop calling me Sister Sadie<br>
          Oh but this whole country is full of lies<br>
          You're all gonna die and die like flies<br>
          I don't trust you any more<br>
          You keep on saying "Go slow!"<br>
          "Go slow!"<br>
          But that's just the trouble<br>
