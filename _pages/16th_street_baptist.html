              And I mean every word of it<br>
              Alabama's gotten me so upset<br>
              Tennessee made me lose my rest<br>
              And everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam<br>

              And everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam<br>
              Can't you see it<br>
              Can't you feel it<br>
              It's all in the air<br>
              I can't stand the pressure much longer<br>
              Somebody say a prayer<br>
              Alabama's gotten me so upset<br>
              Tennessee made me lose my rest<br>
              And everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam<br>
              This is a show tune<br>
              But the show hasn't been written for it, yet<br>
              Hound dogs on my trail<br>
              School children sitting in jail<br>
              Black cat cross my path<br>
              I think every day's gonna be my last<br>
              Lord have mercy on this land of mine<br>
              We all gonna get it in due time<br>
              I don't belong here<br>
              I don't belong there<br>
              I've even stopped believing in prayer<br>
              Don't tell me<br>
              I tell you<br>
              Me and my people just about due<br>
              I've been there so I know<br>
              They keep on saying "Go slow!"<br>
              But that's just the trouble<br>
              "Do it slow"<br>
              Washing the windows<br>
              "Do it slow"<br>
              Picking the cotton<br>
              "Do it slow"<br>
              You're just plain rotten<br>
              "Do it slow"<br>
              You're too damn lazy<br>
              "Do it slow"<br>
              The thinking's crazy<br>
              "Do it slow"<br>
              Where am I going<br>
              What am I doing<br>
              I don't know<br>
              I don't know<br>
              Just try to do your very best<br>
              Stand up be counted with all the rest<br>
              For everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam<br>
              I made you thought I was kiddin'<br>
              Picket lines<br>
              School boy cots<br>
              They try to say it's a communist plot<br>
              All I want is equality<br>
              For my sister my brother my people and me<br>
              Yes you lied to me all these years<br>
              You told me to wash and clean my ears<br>
              And talk real fine just like a lady<br>
              And you'd stop calling me Sister Sadie<br>
              Oh but this whole country is full of lies<br>
              You're all gonna die and die like flies<br>
              I don't trust you any more<br>
              You keep on saying "Go slow!"<br>
              "Go slow!"<br>
              But that's just the trouble<br>
              Desegregation<br>
              "Do it slow"<br>
              Mass participation<br>
              "Do it slow"<br>
              Reunification<br>
              "Do it slow"<br>
              Do things gradually<br>
              "Do it slow"<br>
              But bring more tragedy<br>
              "Do it slow"<br>
              Why don't you see it<br>
              Why don't you feel it<br>
              I don't know<br>
              I don't know<br>
              You don't have to live next to me<br>
              Just give me my equality<br>
              Everybody knows about Mississippi<br>
              Everybody knows about Alabama<br>
              Everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam<br>
              That's it!<br>
