            We shall overcome, we shall overcome,
            We shall overcome someday;
            Oh, deep in my heart, I do believe,
            We shall overcome someday.
            The Lord will see us through, The Lord will see us through,
            The Lord will see us through someday;
            Oh, deep in my heart, I do believe,
            We shall overcome someday.
            We're on to victory, We're on to victory,
            We're on to victory someday;
            Oh, deep in my heart, I do believe,
            We're on to victory someday.
            We'll walk hand in hand, we'll walk hand in hand,
            We'll walk hand in hand someday;
            Oh, deep in my heart, I do believe,
            We'll walk hand in hand someday.
            We are not afraid, we are not afraid,
            We are not afraid today;
            Oh, deep in my heart, I do believe,
            We are not afraid today.
            The truth shall make us free, the truth shall make us free,
            The truth shall make us free someday;
            Oh, deep in my heart, I do believe,
            The truth shall make us free someday.
            We shall live in peace, we shall live in peace,
            We shall live in peace someday;
            Oh, deep in my heart, I do believe,
            We shall live in peace someday.
