              At a day in your celebration</button><br>
              'Cause we all know in our minds<br>
              That there ought to be a time<br>
              That we can set aside<br>
              To show just how much we love you<br>
              And I'm sure you would agree<br>
              What could fit more perfectly<br>
              Than to have a world party on the day you came to be<br>
              Happy birthday to you<br>
              Happy birthday to you<br>
              Happy birthday<br>
              Happy birthday to you<br>
              Happy birthday to you<br>
              Happy birthday<br>
              I just never understood<br>

              Could not have a day that would</button><br>
              Be set aside for his recognition<br>
              Because it should never be<br>
              Just because some cannot see<br>
              The dream as clear as he<br>
              That they should make it become an illusion<br>
              And we all know everything<br>
              That he stood for time will bring<br>
              For in peace, our hearts will sing<br>
              Thanks to Martin Luther King<br>
              Happy birthday to you<br>
              Happy birthday to you<br>
              Happy birthday<br>
              Happy birthday to you<br>
              Happy birthday to you<br>
              Happy birthday<br>
              Why has there never been a holiday<br>
              Where peace is celebrated<br>
              All throughout the world?<br>
              The time is overdue<br>
              For people like me and you<br>
              Who know the way to truth<br>
              Is love and unity to all God's children<br>
              It should be a great event<br>
              And the whole day should be spent<br>
              In full remembrance<br>
              Of those who lived and died for the oneness of all people<br>
              So let us all begin<br>
              We know that love can win<br>
              Let it out, don't hold it in<br>
              Sing it loud as you can<br>
              Happy birthday to you<br>
              Happy birthday to you<br>

              Happy birthday to you<br>
              Happy birthday<br>
              Happy birthday<br>
              Happy birthday<br>
              Happy birthday<br>
              Ooh, yeah<br>
              Happy birthday<br>
              Happy birthday<br>
              Happy birthday<br>
              Happy birthday<br>
              We know the key to unity of all people<br>
              Is in the dream that you had so long ago<br>
              That lives in all of the hearts of people<br>
              That believe in unity<br>
              (Happy birthday)<br>
              We'll make the dream become a reality<br>
              I know we will<br>
              Because our hearts tell us so<br>
              Happy birthday<br>
              Happy birthday<br>
              Happy birthday<br>
              Happy birthday<br>
              Happy birthday<br>
              Happy birthday<br>
