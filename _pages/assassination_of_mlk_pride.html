              One man come in the name of love<br>
              One man come and go.<br>
              One man come he to justify<br>
              One man to overthrow.<br>
          
              In the name of love<br>
              What more in the name of love.<br>
              In the name of love<br>
              What more in the name of love.<br>
          
              One man caught on a barbed wire fence<br>
              One man he resist<br>
              One man washed up on an empty beach<br>
              One man betrayed with a kiss.<br>
          
              In the name of love<br>
              What more in the name of love.<br>
              In the name of love<br>
              What more in the name of love.<br>
