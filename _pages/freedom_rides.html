          <div class="lyrics">
                  I left my home in Norfolk Virginia <br>
                  California on my mind<br>
                  <button type="button" class="popover-lyric" data-bs-container="body" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-trigger="hover" data-bs-placement="right" data-bs-content="Greyhound was the name of a bus used during the freedom rides"> I Straddled that Greyhound,</button><br>
                  and rolled in into Raleigh and all across Carolina<br>
              
                  <button type="button" class="popover-lyric" data-bs-container="body" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-trigger="hover" data-bs-placement="right" data-bs-content="Berry references places on his journey and the cities where the freedom riders made stops">Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill</button><br>
                  And we never was a minute late<br>
                  We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown<br>
                  Rollin' out of Georgia state<br>
              
                  We had more trouble it turned into a struggle,<br>
                  <button type="button" class="popover-lyric" data-bs-container="body" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-trigger="hover" data-bs-placement="right" data-bs-content=" In Alabama during the freedom rides, a bus was firebombed">Half way 'cross Alabama</button><br>
                  And that 'hound broke down and left us all stranded<br>
                  In downtown Birmingham<br>
                  
                  Right away, I bought me a through train ticket<br>
                  Ridin' cross Mississippi clean<br>
                  <button type="button" class="popover-lyric" data-bs-container="body" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-trigger="hover" data-bs-placement="right" data-bs-content="In Birmingham during the freedom rides, a mob attacked a group of freedom riders">And I was on that midnight flier out of Birmingham</button><br>
                  Smoking into New Orleans<br>
                  Somebody help me get out of Louisiana<br>
                  Just help me get to Houston town<br>
                  There are people there who care a little 'bout me<br>
                  And they won't let the poor boy down<br>
              
                  Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit<br>
                  Put luggage in my hands,<br>
                  And I woke up high over Albuquerque<br>
                  On a jet to the promised land<br>
        
                  Workin' on a T-bone steak a la carte<br>
                  Flying over to the Golden State<br>
                  Oh when The pilot told me in thirteen minutes<br>
                  We'd be headin' in the terminal gate<br>
              
                  Swing low chariot, come down easy<br>
                  Taxi to the terminal zone<br>
                  Cut your engines, cool your wings<br>
                  And let me make it to the telephone<br>
              
                  Los Angeles give me Norfolk Virginia<br>
                  Tidewater four ten O nine<br>
                  Tell the folks back home this is the promised land callin'<br>
                  And the poor boy's on the line  <br>
