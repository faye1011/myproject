            I left my home in Norfolk Virginia
            California on my mind
            I Straddled that Greyhound,
            and rolled in into Raleigh and all across Carolina
        
            Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill
            And we never was a minute late
            We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown
            Rollin' out of Georgia state
        
            We had more trouble it turned into a struggle,
            Half way 'cross Alabam
            And that 'hound broke down and left us all stranded
            In downtown Birmingham
        
            Right away, I bought me a through train ticket
            Ridin' cross Mississippi clean
            And I was on that midnight flier out of Birmingham
            Smoking into New Orleans
        
            Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
            Just help me get to Houston town
            There are people there who care a little 'bout me
            And they won't let the poor boy down
        
            Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit
            Put luggage in my hands,
            And I woke up high over Albuquerque
            On a jet to the promised land
        
            Workin' on a T-bone steak a la carte
            Flying over to the Golden State
            Oh when The pilot told me in thirteen minutes
            We'd be headin' in the terminal gate
        
            Swing low chariot, come down easy
            Taxi to the terminal zone
            Cut your engines, cool your wings
            And let me make it to the telephone
        
            Los Angeles give me Norfolk Virginia
            Tidewater four ten O nine
            Tell the folks back home this is the promised land callin'
            And the poor boy's on the line
