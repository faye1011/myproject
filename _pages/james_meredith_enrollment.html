                Ev’rybody’s got their heads bowed down<br>
                The sun don’t shine above the ground<br>
                Ain’t a-goin’ down to Oxford Town<br>
                He went down to Oxford Town<br>
                Guns and clubs followed him down<br>
                All because his face was brown<br>
                Better get away from Oxford Town<br>
                Oxford Town around the bend<br>

                All because of the color of his skin</button><br>
                What do you think about that, my frien’?<br>
                Me and my gal, my gal’s son<br>
                We got met with a tear gas bomb<br>
                I don’t even know why we come<br>
                Goin’ back where we come from<br>
                Oxford Town in the afternoon<br>
                Ev’rybody singin’ a sorrowful tune<br>
                Two men died ’neath the Mississippi moon<br>
                Somebody better investigate soon<br>
                Oxford Town, Oxford Town<br>
                Ev’rybody’s got their heads bowed down<br>
                The sun don’t shine above the ground<br>
                Ain’t a-goin’ down to Oxford Town<br>
