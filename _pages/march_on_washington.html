            Oh freedom, oh freedom, oh freedom over me
            And before I'd be a slave I'd be buried in my grave
            And go home to my Lord and be free
        
            No more mourning, no more mourning, no more mourning over me
            And before I'd be a slave I'd be buried in my grave
            And go home to my Lord and be free
        
            Oh freedom, oh freedom, oh freedom over me
            And before I'd be a slave I'd be buried in my grave
            And go home to my Lord and be free
        
            [Come and Go with Me]
        
            Come, go with me to that land
            Come, go with me to that land
            Go with me to that land
            Where I'm bound
        
            Come, go with me to that land
            Come, go with me to that land
            Go with me to that land
            Where I'm bound
        
            There's no kneeling in that land
            There's no kneeling in that land
            No kneeling in that land
            Where I'm bound
        
            There's no kneeling in that land
            There's no kneeling in that land
            No kneeling in that land
            Where I'm bound
        
            Come and go with me to that land
            Come and go with me to that land
            Go with me to that land
            Where I'm bound
        
            Come and go with me to that land
            Come and go with me to that land
            Go with me to that land
            Where I'm bound
