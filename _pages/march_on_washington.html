              Oh freedom, oh freedom, oh freedom over me <br>
              And before I'd be a slave I'd be buried in my grave<br>
              And go home to my Lord and be free<br>
          
              No more mourning, no more mourning, no more mourning over me<br>
              And before I'd be a slave I'd be buried in my grave<br>
              And go home to my Lord and be free<br>
          
              Oh freedom, oh freedom, oh freedom over me<br>
              And before I'd be a slave I'd be buried in my grave<br>
              And go home to my Lord and be free<br>
