            We are soldiers in the army
            We've got to fight although we have to cry,
            We've got to hold up the blood-stained banner,
            We've got to hold it up until we die.
            We are soldiers (we are soldiers)
            In the army (in the army)
            We've got to fight (We've got to fight although we have to cry)
            We've got a cross (We've got to hold up the blood stained banner)
            We've got to hold it up (We've got to hold it up until we die)
            I
            My mother was a soldier
            She had her hands on the gospel plow
            But one day she got old
            She couldn't fight any more
            She said I'll stand here and fight on anyhow. Oh,
