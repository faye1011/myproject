      <div class="col-6" id="column-one">      
        Paul and Silas bound in jail<br>
        Had no money for to go their bail<br>
        Keep your eyes on the prize, hold on<br>
        Paul and Silas thought they was lost<br>
        Dungeon shook and the chains come off<br>
        Keep your eyes on the prize, hold on<br>
        Freedom's name is mighty sweet<br>
        And soon we're gonna meet<br>
        Keep your eyes on the prize, hold on<br>
        I got my hand on the gospel plow<br>
        Won't take nothing for my journey now<br>
        Keep your eyes on the prize, hold on<br>
        Hold on, hold on<br>
        Keep your eyes on the prize, hold on<br>
        Soozie!<br>
        Only chain that a man can stand<br>
        Is that chain o' hand on hand<br>
        Keep your eyes on the prize, hold on<br>
        I'm gonna board that big greyhound<br>
        Carry the love from town to town<br>
        Keep your eyes on the prize, hold on<br>
        Hold on, hold on<br>
        Keep your eyes on the prize, hold on<br>
        Hey!<br>
        Hey!<br>
        Now only thing I did was wrong<br>
        Stayin' in the wilderness too long<br>
        Keep your eyes on the prize, hold on<br>
        The only thing we did was right<br>
        Was the day we started to fight<br>
        Keep your eyes on the prize, hold on<br>
        Hold on, hold on<br>
        Keep your eyes on the prize, hold on<br>
        One, two!<br>
        (The only thing we did was wrong)<br>
        (Staying in the wilderness too long)<br>
        (Keep your eyes on the prize, hold on)<br>
        Woah, woah!<br>
        (The only thing we did was right)<br>
        (Was the day we started to fight)<br>
        (Keep your eyes on the prize, hold on)<br>
        Hold on, hold on<br>
        Keep your eyes on the prize, hold on<br>
        Hold on, hold on<br>
        Keep your eyes on the prize, hold on<br>
        Ain't been to heaven but I been told<br>
        Streets up there are paved with gold<br>
