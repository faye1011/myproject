            <span class="line1" onmouseover="showMore()" onmouseout="showMore()">I was born by the river, in a little tent</span>
            Oh, and just like the river
            I've been running ever since
            <span class="line2"onmouseover="showMore2()" onmouseout="showMore2()">It's been a long</span> 
            A long time coming
            But I know a change gonna come
            Oh, yes it will
            It's been too hard living
            But I'm afraid to die
            'Cause I don't know what's up there
            Beyond the sky
            It's been a long
            A long time coming
            But I know a change gonna come
            Oh, yes it will
            I go to the movie
            And I go downtown
            Somebody keep telling me
            Don't hang around
            It's been a long
            A long time coming
            But I know, a change gonna come
            Oh, yes it will
            Then I go to my brother
            And I say, brother, help me please
            But he winds up, knockin' me
            Back down on my knees
            Oh, there been times that I thought
            I couldn't last for long
            But now I think I'm able, to carry on
            It's been a long
            A long time coming
            But I know a change gonna come
            Oh, yes it will
