          I was born by the river, in a little tent <br>
          Oh, and just like the river<br>
          I've been running ever since<br>
          It's been a long <br>
          A long time coming<br>

          Oh, yes it will<br>
          It's been too hard living<br>
          But I'm afraid to die<br>
          'Cause I don't know what's up there<br>
          Beyond the sky<br>
          It's been a long<br>
          A long time coming <br>
          But I know a change gonna come<br>
          Oh, yes it will<br>
          I go to the movie<br>
          And I go downtown<br>
          Somebody keep telling me<br>
       
          Don't hang around<br>
          It's been a long<br>
          A long time coming<br>
          But I know, a change gonna come<br>
          Oh, yes it will<br>

          And I say, brother, help me please<br>
          But he winds up, knockin' me<br>
          Back down on my knees<br> 
          Oh, there been times that I thought<br>
          I couldn't last for long<br>
          But now I think I'm able, to carry on<br>
          It's been a long<br>
          A long time coming<br>
          But I know a change gonna come<br>
          Oh, yes it will <br>
