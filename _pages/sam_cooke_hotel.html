          I was born by the river, in a little tent <br>
          Oh, and just like the river<br>
          I've been running ever since<br>
          It's been a long <br>
          A long time coming<br>
          But I know a change gonna come<br>
          Oh, yes it will<br>
          It's been too hard living<br>
          But I'm afraid to die<br>

          'Cause I don't know what's up there<br>
          Beyond the sky<br>
          It's been a long<br>
          A long time coming <br>
          But I know a change gonna come<br>
          Oh, yes it will<br>
          I go to the movie<br>
          And I go downtown<br>
          Somebody keep telling me<br>

          Don't hang around<br>
