            Be not dismayed whate'er betide
            God will take care of you
            Beneath His wings of love abide
            God will take care of you
            God will take care of you
            Through every day, o'er all the way
            He will take care of you
            God will take care of you
            No matter what may be the test
            God will take care of you
            Lean, weary one, upon His breast
            God will take care of you
            God will take care of you
            Through every day, o'er all the way
            He will take care of you
            God will take care of you
            He will take care of you
            God will take care of you
