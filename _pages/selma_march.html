              Beneath His wings of love abide<br>
              God will take care of you<br>
              God will take care of you<br>
              Through every day, o'er all the way<br>
              He will take care of you<br>
              God will take care of you<br>
              No matter what may be the test<br>
              God will take care of you<br>
              Lean, weary one, upon His breast<br>
              God will take care of you<br>
              God will take care of you<br>
              Through every day, o'er all the way<br>
              He will take care of you<br>
              God will take care of you<br>
              He will take care of you<br>
              God will take care of you<br>
