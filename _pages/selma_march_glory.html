            <p>
              One day when the glory comes<br>
            It will be ours, it will be ours<br>
            Oh one day when the war is won<br>
            We will be sure, we will be sure<br>
            Oh glory (Glory, glory)<br>
            Oh (Glory, glory)<br>
            Hands to the Heavens, no man, no weapon<br>
            Formed against, yes glory is destined<br>
            Every day women and men become legends<br>
            Sins that go against our skin become blessings<br>
            The movement is a rhythm to us<br>
            Freedom is like religion to us<br>
            Justice is juxtapositionin' us<br>
            Justice for all just ain't specific enough<br>
            One son died, his spirit is revisitin' us<br>
            Truant livin' livin' in us, resistance is us<br>
            That's why Rosa sat on the bus<br>
            That's why we walk through Ferguson with our hands up<br>
            When it go down we woman and man up<br>
            They say, "Stay down", and we stand up<br>
            Shots, we on the ground, the camera panned up<br>
            King pointed to the mountain top and we ran up<br>
            One day when the glory comes<br>
            It will be ours, it will be ours<br>
            Oh one day when the war is won<br>
            We will be sure, we will be sure<br>
            Oh glory (Glory, glory)<br>
            Oh (Glory, glory)<br>
            Now the war is not over, victory isn't won<br>
            And we'll fight on to the finish, then when it's all done<br>
            We'll cry glory, oh glory (Glory, glory)<br>
            Oh (Glory, glory)<br>
            We'll cry glory, oh glory (Glory, glory)<br>
            Oh (Glory, glory)<br>
            Selma's now for every man, woman and child<br>
            Even Jesus got his crown in front of a crowd<br>
            They marched with the torch, we gon' run with it now<br>
            Never look back, we done gone hundreds of miles<br>
            From dark roads he rose, to become a hero<br>
            Facin' the league of justice, his power was the people<br>
            Enemy is lethal, a king became regal<br>
            Saw the face of Jim Crow under a bald eagle<br>
            The biggest weapon is to stay peaceful<br>
            We sing, our music is the cuts that we bleed through<br>
            Somewhere in the dream we had an epiphany<br>
            Now we right the wrongs in history<br>
            No one can win the war individually<br>
            It takes the wisdom of the elders and young people's energy<br>
            Welcome to the story we call victory<br>
            The comin' of the Lord, my eyes have seen the glory<br>
            One day when the glory comes<br>
            It will be ours, it will be ours<br>
            Oh one day when the war is won<br>
            We will be sure, we will be sure<br>
            Oh glory (Glory, glory)<br>
            Oh (Glory, glory)<br>
            Oh glory (Glory, glory)<br>
            Hey (Glory, glory)<br>
            When the war is won, when it's all said and done<br>
            We'll cry glory (Glory, glory)<br>
            Oh (Glory, glory)  <br>
          </p>
