              Southern trees bear a strange fruit <br>
              Blood on the leaves and blood at the root<br>
              <button type="button" class="popover-lyric" data-bs-container="body" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-trigger="hover" data-bs-placement="right" data-bs-content="The song directly references the lynchings of black Americans">Black bodies swingin' in the Southern breeze</button><br>

              Pastoral scene of the gallant South<br>
              The bulgin' eyes and the twisted mouth<br>
              Scent of magnolias sweet and fresh<br>
              Then the sudden smell of burnin' flesh<br>
              Here is a fruit for the crows to pluck<br>
              For the rain to gather<br>
              For the wind to suck<br>
              <button type="button" class="popover-lyric" data-bs-container="body" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-trigger="hover" data-bs-placement="right" data-bs-content="Heavy loaded words used such as 'rot' are compared with earlier more gentle images of 'scent of magnolias sweet and fresh' (O'Dell, 2002)">For the sun to rot </button><br>
              For the tree to drop<br>
              Here is a strange and bitter crop<br>
