            Southern trees bear a strange fruit
            Blood on the leaves and blood at the root
            Black bodies swingin' in the Southern breeze
            Strange fruit hangin' from the poplar trees
            Pastoral scene of the gallant South
            The bulgin' eyes and the twisted mouth
            Scent of magnolias sweet and fresh
            Then the sudden smell of burnin' flesh
            Here is a fruit for the crows to pluck
            For the rain to gather
            For the wind to suck
            For the sun to rot
            For the tree to drop
            Here is a strange and bitter crop
            </pre>
