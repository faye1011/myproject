              Southern trees bear a strange fruit <br>
              Blood on the leaves and blood at the root<br>

              Pastoral scene of the gallant South<br>
              The bulgin' eyes and the twisted mouth<br>
              Scent of magnolias sweet and fresh<br>
              Then the sudden smell of burnin' flesh<br>
              Here is a fruit for the crows to pluck<br>
              For the rain to gather<br>
              For the wind to suck<br>

              For the tree to drop<br>
              Here is a strange and bitter crop<br>
