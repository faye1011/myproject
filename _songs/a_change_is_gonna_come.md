lyrics: |
    I was born by the river, in a little tent
    Oh, and just like the river
    I've been running ever since
    It's been a long
    A long time coming
    But I know a change gonna come
    Oh, yes it will
    It's been too hard living
    But I'm afraid to die
    'Cause I don't know what's up there
    Beyond the sky
    It's been a long
    A long time coming
    But I know a change gonna come
    Oh, yes it will
    I go to the movie
    And I go downtown
    Somebody keep telling me
    Don't hang around
    It's been a long
    A long time coming
    But I know, a change gonna come
    Oh, yes it will
    Then I go to my brother
    And I say, brother, help me please
    But he winds up, knockin' me
    Back down on my knees
    Oh, there been times that I thought
    I couldn't last for long
    But now I think I'm able, to carry on
    It's been a long
    A long time coming
    But I know a change gonna come
    Oh, yes it will
