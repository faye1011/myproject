lyrics: |
    Be not dismayed whate'er betide
    God will take care of you
    Beneath His wings of love abide
    God will take care of you
    God will take care of you
    Through every day, o'er all the way
    He will take care of you
    God will take care of you
    No matter what may be the test
    God will take care of you
    Lean, weary one, upon His breast
    God will take care of you
    God will take care of you
    Through every day, o'er all the way
    He will take care of you
    God will take care of you
    He will take care of you
    God will take care of you
