description1: The song Mississippi Goddam was Simones response to the racially motivated murders of Emmett Till and Medgars Evers in Mississippi as well as the 16th Street Baptist Church Bombing. 
description: Simone said that although there were people who protested the song, they missed the point. She believed an artists duty is to reflect the times and at that desperate time, she couldn't help but be involved.
