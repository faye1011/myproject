lyrics: | 
    Oh freedom, oh freedom, oh freedom over me
    And before I'd be a slave I'd be buried in my grave
    And go home to my Lord and be free

    No more mourning, no more mourning, no more mourning over me
    And before I'd be a slave I'd be buried in my grave
    And go home to my Lord and be free

    Oh freedom, oh freedom, oh freedom over me
    And before I'd be a slave I'd be buried in my grave
    And go home to my Lord and be free

    [Come and Go with Me]

    Come, go with me to that land
    Come, go with me to that land
    Go with me to that land
    Where I'm bound

    Come, go with me to that land
    Come, go with me to that land
    Go with me to that land
    Where I'm bound

    There's no kneeling in that land
    There's no kneeling in that land
    No kneeling in that land
    Where I'm bound

    There's no kneeling in that land
    There's no kneeling in that land
    No kneeling in that land
    Where I'm bound

    Come and go with me to that land
    Come and go with me to that land
    Go with me to that land
    Where I'm bound

    Come and go with me to that land
    Come and go with me to that land
    Go with me to that land
    Where I'm bound

    [I'm on My Way]

    I'm on my way
    And I won't turn back
    I'm on my way
    And I won't turn back
    I'm on my way
    And I won't turn back
    I'm on my way
    Hey, I'm on my way

    Gonna ask my brother
    Want to come with me?
    Gonna ask my brother
    Won't you come with me?
    I'm gonna ask my brother
    Won't you come with me?
    I'm on my way
    Hey, I'm on my way

    Gonna ask my Captain
    Won't you let me go?
    Ask my Captain
    Won't you let me go?
    I'm gonna ask my Captain
    Won't you let me go?
    I'm on my way
    Thank God, I'm on my way

    And if he says no, no, no, no
    I'll go anyhow
    If he says no
    Gonna go anyhow
    And if he says no
    Gonna go anyhow
    I'm on my way
    Hey God, I'm on my way

    I'm on my way, I'm on my way
    I won't turn back
    I'm on my way
    And I won't turn back
    I'm on my way
    And I won't turn back
    I'm on my way
    Thank God, I'm on my way
