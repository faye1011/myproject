lyrics: |
    Oxford town, Oxford town
    Everybody's got their heads bowed down
    Sun don't shine above the ground
    Ain't a-goin' down to Oxford town
    He went down to Oxford town
    Guns and clubs followed him down
    All because his face was brown
    Better get away from Oxford town
    Oxford town around the bend
    Come to the door, he couldn't get in
    All because of the color of his skin
    What do you think about that, my friend?
    Me, my gal, and my gal's son
    We got met with a tear gas bomb
    Don't even know why we come
    We're goin' back where we came from
    Oxford town in the afternoon
    Everybody's singin' a sorrowful tune
    Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon
    Somebody better investigate soon.
