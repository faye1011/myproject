lyrics: |
    One man come in the name of love
    One man come and go.
    One man come he to justify
    One man to overthrow.

    In the name of love
    What more in the name of love.
    In the name of love
    What more in the name of love.

    One man caught on a barbed wire fence
    One man he resist
    One man washed up on an empty beach
    One man betrayed with a kiss.

    In the name of love
    What more in the name of love.
    In the name of love
    What more in the name of love.

    Early morning, April four
    Shot rings out in the Memphis sky.
    Free at last, they took your life
    They could not take your pride.

    In the name of love
    What more in the name of love.
    In the name of love
    What more in the name of love.

    In the name of love
    What more in the name of love.
    In the name of love
    What more in the name of love.
