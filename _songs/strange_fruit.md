   Holiday was reluctant to sing and perform the song when it was initially brought to her, being out of character to what she would initially sing as the lyrics were about lynching of black Americans happening at the time in the Southern States of America. However, despite this, it turned into be one of her most renowned songs which reached number 16 on the charts.
