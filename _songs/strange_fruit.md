    In order to record the song, Billie Holiday had to be released from the contract from her record label as they refused to allow her to record it. 

    There have been many versions of Strange Fruit from Nina Simone, UB40, to Kanye West sampling the song on his Yeezus Album

    Billie Holiday’s version eventually sold over 1 million copies. 
    In 1999, Time magazine voted Strange Fruit the song of the Century.
lyrics: |
    Southern trees bear a strange fruit
    Blood on the leaves and blood at the root
    Black bodies swingin' in the Southern breeze
    Strange fruit hangin' from the poplar trees
    Pastoral scene of the gallant South
    The bulgin' eyes and the twisted mouth
    Scent of magnolias sweet and fresh
    Then the sudden smell of burnin' flesh
    Here is a fruit for the crows to pluck
    For the rain to gather
    For the wind to suck
    For the sun to rot
    For the tree to drop
    Here is a strange and bitter crop
