description: Pete Seeger first heard the song sung by Tobacco workers in the late 1940s.  Prior to the Albany movement, the song was commonly performed within the Southern white folk tradition. When the organisation was led by Bernice Johnson Reagon, black activists changed the structure and tempo of the song which turned it into a protest song sung at mass gatherings.
