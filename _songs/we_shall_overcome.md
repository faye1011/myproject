lyrics: |
    We shall overcome, we shall overcome,
    We shall overcome someday;
    Oh, deep in my heart, I do believe,
    We shall overcome someday.
    The Lord will see us through, The Lord will see us through,
    The Lord will see us through someday;
    Oh, deep in my heart, I do believe,
    We shall overcome someday.
    We're on to victory, We're on to victory,
    We're on to victory someday;
    Oh, deep in my heart, I do believe,
    We're on to victory someday.
    We'll walk hand in hand, we'll walk hand in hand,
    We'll walk hand in hand someday;
    Oh, deep in my heart, I do believe,
    We'll walk hand in hand someday.
    We are not afraid, we are not afraid,
    We are not afraid today;
    Oh, deep in my heart, I do believe,
    We are not afraid today.
    The truth shall make us free, the truth shall make us free,
    The truth shall make us free someday;
    Oh, deep in my heart, I do believe,
    The truth shall make us free someday.
    We shall live in peace, we shall live in peace,
    We shall live in peace someday;
    Oh, deep in my heart, I do believe,
    We shall live in peace someday.
